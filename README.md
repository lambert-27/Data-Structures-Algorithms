**By:** Mark Lambert (C00192497), Darius Herdes (C00296548)

**Submission Date:** 10/12/2024

This is a final, group-based project in the format of a report, designed to demonstrate an understanding of the implementation of hash and graph data structures. 
The report also includes a coded prototype to showcase the implementation of the graph data structure. 

The project aims to reflect our ability to work effectively in a group setting.
